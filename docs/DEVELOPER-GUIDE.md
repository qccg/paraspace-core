# Developer Guide

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the ParaSpace development :hammer_and_wrench:

### Initialize and install deps

```
yarn
touch .env
make init
```

### Build

```
make build
```

### Test

```
make test
make fast-test
```

### Fork

```

NETWORK=localhost
ALCHEMY_KEY=
DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC=
ETHERSCAN_VERIFICATION=false
MOCHA_JOBS=1
DB_PATH=deployed-contracts.json
FORK=goerli|mainnet
FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER=8035792|15909885

make launch

```

### Upgrade Existing Fork

Before upgrading, you need to update REVISIONs of Pools, NTokens, PTokens

```
NETWORK=localhost
ALCHEMY_KEY=
DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC=
ETHERSCAN_VERIFICATION=false
MOCHA_JOBS=1
DB_PATH=deployed-contracts.json # must be the live fork's deploed-contracts.json
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545 # impersonate to paraspace admin for upgrading
FORK=goerli|mainnet

make upgrade
```

### Upgrade Live Network

Before upgrading, you need to update REVISIONs of Pools, NTokens, PTokens

```
NETWORK=goerli|mainnet
DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC=
ALCHEMY_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_VERIFICATION=false
MOCHA_JOBS=1
DB_PATH=deployed-contracts.json

make upgrade
```

### Available commands

```

make help

```

### Tests Instructure

## Structure

Use flatten layout

## Coding

1. Use fixtures to manage evm state: We have a pre-built pure evm snapshot call `testEnv` which
   contains all used contracts and necessary transactions.

Example 1:
You make a story contains two step, and steps have to be executed in sequence. You should init the
testEnv at the before hook.

```typescript
describe("A story", () => {
  let testEnv: TestEnv;
  before(async () => {
    testEnv = await loadFixture(testEnvFixture);
  });

  it("Step 01", async () => {});
  it("Step 02", async () => {});
});
```

Example 2:
You wanna do a serial of tests for different paths of a certain secenrio. You make changes and wanna
reset to that state during following steps.

```typescript
const fixture = async () => {
  const testEnv = await loadFixture(testEnvFixture);
  testEnv.doSomething();
  return testEnv;
};

describe("A secenrio", () => {
  it("Should succeed", async () => {
    const testEnv = await loadFixture(fixture);
  });

  it("should fail", async () => {
    const testEnv = await loadFixture(fixture);
  });
});
```

Hint: Happy to see you fix the code smell when you were refacting this file.
